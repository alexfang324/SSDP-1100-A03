                I was a academic researcher in physics, a self-employed businessman, and now a software
                developer in training. I've developed useful programs and apps during my previous experience 
                that sparkled my interest in pursuing a software developer career. My goal is to become a 
                well-rounded full stack developer who is able to attack a problem from all angles.
